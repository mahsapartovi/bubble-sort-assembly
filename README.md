# bubble-sort-assembly

*****author :mahsa partovi***

// Bubble sort is often one of the first sorting algorithms people learn. 
It works by iterating through the list of items to be sorted and swapping items that are out of order. 
After each iteration, if any swaps were made it iterates again. This results in the largest (or smallest) value “bubbling” up to the end of the list.//
